## Oh hey, welcome to my GitHub ðŸ˜„

I'm Gabriel Pinheiro (he/him), a developer from Brazil. I currently work at [@ZupIT](https://github.com/ZupIT/). Java and TypeScript are generally my go-tos at work and for side projects.

In my free time I like to play the piano, ~~lose at~~ play chess and mess with IoT (all while I drink **a lot** of coffee).

Have a look at some of the open source projects I'm working on right now:

ðŸ‘‰ [Mocko](https://mocko.dev/) is a mocking tool that lets you create dynamic HTTP mocks, proxy your API, choose what to mock and create mock templates;

ðŸ‘‰ [Elba](https://github.com/gabriel-pinheiro/elba-balancer) is a customizable HTTP load balancer aimed at retry options and monitoring. It's ideal for integrations behind unstable VPNs or networks;

ðŸ‘‰ [My Port Forward](https://github.com/gabriel-pinheiro/my-port-forward): Create named Kubernetes port-forward groups and start them with a single command;

ðŸ‘‰ [Ping Exporter](https://github.com/gabriel-pinheiro/ping-exporter): Export ping (ICMP) latency and loss data to Prometheus.
